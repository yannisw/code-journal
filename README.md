  The Journey Begins
</h2>
<h3>
  #1 The First Week
  <br>
  29/08/2018 - 02/09/2018</h3>
<p>
  Started on learning how to code again.
  <br>
  I left off a year ago, where I was four weeks into the cs50 course.
  <br>
  This time, I started with the free udemy course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/build-your-first-website-in-1-week/">Build Your First Website in 1 Week with HTML5 and CSS3</a>. 
  <br>
  I also started to follow <a href="https://hackernoon.com/learn-to-code-in-2018-get-hired-and-have-fun-along-the-way-b338247eed6a">Andrei Neagoie's guide</a> on learning to program.
</p>
<p>
  Other learning resources I used:
  <ul>
    <li>Free Code Camp</li>
    <li>Code Academy</li>
  </ul>
  These are the resources I find I would use every now and then, but not my main learning resource.
  I find that the best way to use Free Code Camp is by completing the projects, and using Google if you got stuck.
  Code Academy is great at getting an introduction to the language.
</p>

  <strong>Reflections:</strong>
  <br>
  The main reason I struggled learning to code last year was not being able to see past the smaller things to the bigger picture. I think the free udemy course really helped in making me understand that I was capable of making something pretty. This made me start to think of the possibilities. It also helped in linking my knowledge I learned from the html and css section of the Free Code Camp, Code Academy and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4S8zfLdLgQ&feature=youtu.be&list=PLoYCgNOIyGAB_8_iq1cL8MVeun7cB6eNc">LearnCode.academy</a>, which was a resource recommended by Andrei Neagoie's learn to code in 2018 guide. 
</p>

  #2 - #3 The Second and Third Week
  <br>
03/09/2018 - 16/09/2018</h3>
<p>
    Finished the Udemy course I started in the first week.
    <br>
     Sections I have completed from the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/learn-to-code-in-2018-get-hired-and-have-fun-along-the-way-b338247eed6a">Learn to Code in 2018 guide:</a>
<ul>
    <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq7dqdHCc7U&feature=youtu.be&list=PLoYCgNOIyGAB_8_iq1cL8MVeun7cB6eNc">How to build a website/get a domain/and have it up and running</a>.</li>
    <li>How Does the internet work</li>
    <li>How to use the command Line</li>
    <li>How does HTML, CSS and Javascript fit together</li>
</ul> 
</p>

</p>
<p>
     I have also completed the following projects on Free Code Camp:
    <ul>
        <li>Build a Tribute Page</li>
        <li>Build a Product Landing Page</li>
        <li>Build a Technical Documentation Page</li>
        <li>Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>My strategy for completing all of this was to watch at least one video from each source per session, and to keep going when I felt like it. When I started to feel bored with the videos from one source, I would pick up another video from another source to keep things interesting for me. It was also important for me to code along as I was watching the videos, as I remember things better when I was doing it.</p>
<h3>
  #4 Week 4 
  <br>
17/09/2018 - 23/09/2018</h3>
<p>Completed the Responsive Web Design Certification on Free Code Camp.</p>
<p>
    Started going through the second month section of the learn to code guide. I will continue the other sections in the first month when I feel like I want to watch a video without consuming too much brain power. I feel like the second month section of the guide may take more than a month to complete.
</p>
  
<h3>
  #5 Week 5 
  <br>
24/09/2018 - 30/09/2018</h3>
<p>Progress made so far with readings:<ul><li>javascript.info: Lesson 35 of 67 of the Javascript Language section, which was on arrays</li><li>Midway through Chapter 3 of Eloquent Javascript</li></ul></p>
<p>Progress made from Courses: <ul><li>Conditional statements of the Introduction to Javascript Programming from Frontend Masters</li><li>Started on the iterables section on the Introduction to Javascript course on Codeacademy.</li></ul></p>
<p>Issues I have found is that progress seems to be slow, and by the end of the week, I am struggling to remember and make connections to concepts I learned earlier.</p>
<p>I am struggling to read Eloquent Javascript. New concepts are not explained fully, and I am needing to rely on googling new concepts. Examples of this include recursive functions</p>
<p>I discovered the <a href="https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript">Watch and Code: Practical Javascript</a> course</p>
<p>This seems to be a nice course as it targets beginners, and we get to build an actual Javascript app from scratch. I will be going to look into this course.</p>

  #6 Week 1 
  <br>
01/10/2018 - 07/10/2018</h3>
<p>I have finished the Practical Javascript course. <p>
<p>I have made my first Javascript application. It's an ugly todo list!</p> 
<p>It works! and that is what matters the most!</p>
<p>So happy! I am finally getting somewhere. Plus, concepts I did not quite understand previously were explained in this course.</p>
<p>Things I learned in this course: <ul><li>How all the knowledge learned previously on things such as objects, arrays, functions all come together in a web application</li><li>Some of the very basics on how to access the DOM in javascript</li><li>How to figure out what <code>this</code> is referring to</li><li>What higher order functions and callbacks are</li><li>How the built-in debugger in chrome can help with figurring how the function runs</li><li>How to break the application down into smaller, managable chunks</li></ul></p>
<p>Readings: <ul><li>Finished reading the array methods section on javascript.info</li></ul><p/>
<p>I also watched the drum kit tutorial for the second time from the javascript30 challenge by Wes Bos.</p>
<p>The first time I watched it was two weeks ago, and I was not able to make much sense out of it.</p>
<p>This time, the tutorial stuck with me a lot better, and I was inspired to start the scaredy cat project.</p>
