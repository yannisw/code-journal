<h2> 
  The First Month
</h2>
<h3>
  The First Week
  <br>
  29/08/2018 - 02/09/2018</h3>
<p>
  Started on learning how to code again.
  <br>
  I left off a year ago, where I was four weeks into the cs50 course.
  <br>
  I started to with the free udemy course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/build-your-first-website-in-1-week/">Build Your First Website in   1 Week with HTML5 and CSS3</a>.
  <br>
  I also started to follow <a href="https://hackernoon.com/learn-to-code-in-2018-get-hired-and-have-fun-along-the-way-b338247eed6a">Andrei Neagoie's guide</a> on learning to program.
</p>
<p>
  Other learning resources I used:
  <ul>
    <li>Free Code Camp</li>
    <li>Code Academy</li>
  </ul>
  These are the resources I find I would use every now and then, but not my main learning resource.
  I find that the best way to use Free Code Camp is by completing the projects, and using Google if you got stuck.
  Code Academy is great at getting an introduction to the language.

  <strong>Reflections:</strong>
  <br>
  The main reason I struggled learning to code last year was not being able to see past the smaller things to the bigger picture. I think the free udemy course really helped in making me understand that I was capable of making something pretty. This made me start to think of the possibilities. It also helped in linking my knowledge I learned from the html and css section of the Free Code Camp, Code Academy and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4S8zfLdLgQ&feature=youtu.be&list=PLoYCgNOIyGAB_8_iq1cL8MVeun7cB6eNc">LearnCode.academy</a>, which was a resource recommended by Andrei Neagoie's learn to code in 2018 guide.

<h3>
  The Second and Third Week
  <br>
03/09/2018 - 16/09/2018</h3>
<p>
    Finished the Udemy course I started in the first week.
    <br>
     Sections I have completed from the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/learn-to-code-in-2018-get-hired-and-have-fun-along-the-way-b338247eed6a">Learn to Code in 2018 guide:</a>
<ul>
    <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq7dqdHCc7U&feature=youtu.be&list=PLoYCgNOIyGAB_8_iq1cL8MVeun7cB6eNc">How to build a website/get a domain/and have it up and running</a>.</li>
    <li>How Does the internet work</li>
    <li>How to use the command Line</li>
    <li>How does HTML, CSS and Javascript fit together</li>
</ul>

<p>
     I have also completed the following projects on Free Code Camp:
    <ul>
        <li>Build a Tribute Page</li>
        <li>Build a Product Landing Page</li>
        <li>Build a Technical Documentation Page</li>
        <li>Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>My strategy for completing all of this was to watch at least one video from each source per session, and to keep going when I felt like it. When I started to feel bored with the videos from one source, I would pick up another video from another source to keep things interesting for me. It was also important for me to code along as I was watching the videos, as I remember things better when I was doing it.</p>
<h3>
  Week 4 
  <br>
17/09/2018 - 23/09/2018</h3>
<p>Completed the Responsive Web Design Certification on Free Code Camp.</p>
<p>
    Started going through the second month section of the learn to code guide. I will continue the other sections in the first month when I feel like I want to watch a video without consuming too much brain power. I feel like the second month section of the guide may take more than a month to complete.
