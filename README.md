  Started on learning how to code again.
  <br>
  I left off a year ago, where I was four weeks into the cs50 course.
  <br>
  I started to take the free udemy course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/build-your-first-website-in-1-week/">Build Your First Website in   1 Week with HTML5 and CSS3</a>.
  <br>
  I also started to follow <a href="https://hackernoon.com/learn-to-code-in-2018-get-hired-and-have-fun-along-the-way-b338247eed6a">Andrei   Neagoie's guide</a> on learning to program.
</p>
<p>
  Other learning resources I used:
  <ul>
    <li>Free Code Camp</li>
    <li>Code Academy</li>
  </ul>
  These are the resources I find I would use every now and then, but not my main learning resource.
  I find that the best way to use Free Code Camp is by completing the projects, and using Google if you got stuck.
  Code Academy is great at getting an introduction to the language.

  <strong>Reflections:</strong>
  <br>
  The main reason I struggled learning to code last year was not being able to see past the smaller things to the bigger picture. I think the free udemy course really helped in making me understand that I was capable of making something pretty. This made me start to think of the possibilities.
