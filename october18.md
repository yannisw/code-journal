### 6 Week 1

### 01/10/2018 - 07/10/2018

I have finished the Practical Javascript course.

I have made my first Javascript application. It's an ugly todo list!

It works! and that is what matters the most!

So happy! I am finally getting somewhere. Plus, concepts I did not quite understand previously were explained in this course.

Things I learned in this course:

- How all the knowledge learned previously on things such as objects, arrays, functions all come together in a web application
- Some of the very basics on how to access the DOM in javascript
- How to figure out what <code>this</code> is referring to
- What higher order functions and callbacks are
- How the built-in debugger in chrome can help with figurring how the function runs
- How to break the application down into smaller, managable chunks

Readings:

- Finished reading the array methods section on javascript.info

I also watched the drum kit tutorial for the second time from the javascript30 challenge by Wes Bos.
The first time I watched it was two weeks ago, and I was not able to make much sense out of it.</p>
This time, the tutorial stuck with me a lot better, and I was inspired to start the scaredy cat project.
