### #6 Week 1

### 01/10/2018 - 07/10/2018

I have finished the Practical Javascript course.

I have made my first Javascript application. It's an ugly todo list!

It works! and that is what matters the most!

So happy! I am finally getting somewhere. Plus, concepts I did not quite understand previously were explained in this course.

Things I learned in this course:

- How all the knowledge learned previously on things such as objects, arrays, functions all come together in a web application
- Some of the very basics on how to access the DOM in javascript
- How to figure out what <code>this</code> is referring to
- What higher order functions and callbacks are
- How the built-in debugger in chrome can help with figurring how the function runs
- How to break the application down into smaller, managable chunks

Readings:

- Finished reading the array methods section on javascript.info

I also watched the drum kit tutorial for the second time from the javascript30 challenge by Wes Bos.
The first time I watched it was two weeks ago, and I was not able to make much sense out of it.</p>
This time, the tutorial stuck with me a lot better, and I was inspired to start the scaredy cat project.

### #7 Week 2

### 08/10/2018 - 14/10/2018

This week, I went through the second tutorial on javascript 30. I made a clock with CSS and javascript.

I have also started to go through the Web Developer Bootcamp course from Colt Steele. 

#### Progress of Personal Project:
I modified the scaredy cat project, so that when a key was pressed, a cat will pop up, and if a key was pressed on the cat, the cat would be hidden.

### #8 Week 3

### 15/10/2018 - 21/10/2018

The Web Developer Bootcamp has been great so far. There were many exercises to practice on, and it helped solidify some of my knowledge I have learned in the past couple of weeks.

#### Progress of Personal Project:
I have added a counter to the scaredy cat project, so that when the correct key was pressed, one point would be added to the counter, and if the incorrect key was pressed, five points would be deducted.

### #9 Week 4

### 22/10/2018 - 28/10/2018

I have started the Yelp Camp project. My plan at this stage, is to go through the entire course, and then go through parts of the backend components of the course as I work through my personal project. All the different routes are starting the make my mind go haywire. 

#### Progress of Personal Project:
Added a login, logout, register placeholder.
